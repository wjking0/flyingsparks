                <p>We have hundreds of happy and satisfied customers, here is a small selection of some of the feedback we have received</p>
<p>"I found the engineer to be very professional, reliable and friendly, and was even prepared to feed my cat while I was away!"
<strong>Lisa, Wimbledon</strong></p>
<p>"Thank you Flying Sparks for your efficient and honest service... and for tidying up afterwards"
<strong>Matthew, Stoke Newington</strong></p>
<p>We had an electrical problem a couple of weeks ago which was not resolved by the first electrician we got in to do the work. Fortunately I was able to contact Darren at Flying Spark Electricians, I wish I had found him earlier.
I telephoned him, he was helpful during our conversation, and an appointment was made. When he camr to my house, he made an appraisal of the work position. He made a call on my bahalf to establish the situation of the work in progress, being sensitive to my concerns all the time, I am not an electrician and so found this most helpful.
Darren did this i believe through his professionalism being ready to help. His expertise was very evident during our whole meeting, and its clear Darren knows his stuff. A very positive man.
I recommend Darren as an electrician, he is a straight forward no nonsense man with an eye to detail. Electrics is his business &amp; he will ensure his work is up to standard &amp; clients satisfaction.
<strong>John H, Merton Park</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to thank you for the work you have done, it looks very neat, and best of all since you fixed the problem found on the 1st floor socket circuit and installed the new consumer unit, we havent had anymore problems with the circuit breaker tripping off.
We will keep your details should we need your services again.
<strong>Philip G, Raynes Park</strong></p>
<p>Darren, of Flying Spark Electricians, came to our flat in early January as we had noticed some unusual electrical cabling coming into one of the bedroom overhead lights. He was very efficient in replying to our emails over the weekend and was extremely flexible in visiting at a time that suited us and meant that we needed to take the minimal amount of time off work. He was punctual and the work that he did has been perfect since his visit. He explained his findings in detail to both myself and my partner (in person and over the phone) and despite us being open to having more extensive work done, he was very honest in his opinion of what the issue was and that additional work was not needed at this stage.
Further to our experience we would happily recommend Darren and will be using him as our first point of contact should we require any further electrical work to be done in the future.
<strong>Lucy C, Wimbledon</strong></p>
<p>We used Darren after buying a small 3 bed property that needed work throughout including a 90%
rewire.
Out of all the tradesmen we have used, Darren was the most reliable, professional and helpful. He did
a great job and we really appreciated it. We would happily recommend Flying Sparks to others.
<strong>Tim R, Putney</strong></p>
<p>On two occasions Darren has carried out work at my home and on both occasions the
work was completed to a good standard at a good price within the time scale agreed.
I have no hesitation in recommending him.
<strong>Richard B, Wimbledon</strong></p>
<p>Darren from Flying Spark Electricians has worked about 5 days in total (cumulatively) in my flat. He
has surveyed the whole electrical system, changed switches and plugs, changed
the consumer unit to the latest standards, moved location of switches, etc...
I have always been very pleased by the work done by Darren. In particular, I find
Darren to be very honest, very reliable and very thorough. He is very detail
oriented, which is definitely an important quality in an electrician, and I do not
hesitate to recommend him.

<strong>Sebastien M, Wimbledon</strong></p>
<p>Darren of Flying Spark Electricians has carried out many jobs for Malabar Construction Ltd over the last four years.
The work he has carried out for Malabar ranges from fault finding and repairing existing installations to replacing a few sockets or light switches to installing new individual circuits or complete rewires.
He is always very thorough and always completes the work to a good standard. He manages his own time and materials, and is 100% reliable with time keeping and the bookings I make with him.
I have no hesitation in continuing to use him in future.</p>
